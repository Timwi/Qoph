<p>Since this is a <em>meta puzzle</em>, it requires answers from earlier puzzles. Reading this solution page will spoil some of these answers.</p>
<p>The circles-in-circles graphics suggest [d that we are looking for words that contain other words. The words on the outside are clues towards the inner words. [ra]]</p>

<p>The next insight is that [o there is actually a third circle inside each circle. The lines from the clues connect with the middle circles, while the innermost circles are the ones connected together. [d We should therefore extract the centers of the words. Since they all have even numbers of letters, [sb we extract the central two letters.]]]</p>

<h2>Notes (warning: meta-meta spoilers) [rna]</h2>
{-na
<p>This was the last meta to be written. For the final meta-meta, we needed it to connect to <a href='../circles'><cite>Circles</cite></a>, so I had the idea of words containing other words and representing them as concentric circles.</p>
<p>A lot of teams did not seem to catch on to the “concentric” idea. Several solvers assumed they had to use the parts of the word at the start and end (e.g. «DOD» and «VAN» from «DODGE MINIVAN»). I am not sure what prompted this intuition.</p>
<p>It was an interesting challenge to come up with clues that were sufficiently vague (e.g. “small horse” is clearly too obvious) but not too vague to be too widely applicable. Unfortunately, I think I missed the mark on some. With “one”, several solvers thought it could refer to «MERGE» in «SUBMERGENCE». With “positive”, I didn’t consider that «BRAIN BOWL» contains «RAINBOW» (huge coincidence). However, once <a href='../the-nuke'><cite>The Nuke</cite></a> is unlocked (or even before then), solvers can find out which of the feeders belong to the episode titles and rule these out that way. I was not too worried about animals in other answers, such as «VOCATIONAL» and «SCATTERING» both containing «CAT», because those weren’t in the center.</p>
