<h1>Comebacks<div class='author'>by Timwi</div></h1>

makeSolutionPage('comebacks', `
<p>These are “Dropquote” puzzles, which require the solver to reconstruct a phrase or sentence by “dropping” the letters from the top of the grid into each column. The letters may not be in the order given, but they will remain in their column.</p>
<p>Pick any dropquote puzzle to start. Once solved, [s it is worth googling for the sentence that comes out. You are likely to find out that [d they are <a href='https://monkeyisland.fandom.com/wiki/Insult_Sword_Fighting'>sword-fighting insults from <cite>The Secret of Monkey Island</cite></a>. With that, the rest of the dropquote puzzles are a breeze. [ra]]]</p>
{-a <p>It appears [o the comebacks are in alphabetical order while the insults are not. Therefore, [c we must reorder the comebacks to fit with the insults. Do we leave the instructions where they are, or do we move them with the comebacks? [s If we leave them where they are, then we would be expected to apply them to the new comeback. In this case, the instruction «LETTER AFTER K» would end up with the comeback «You run THAT fast?», which doesn’t contain a «K». Therefore, [d we must move the instructions with the comebacks and apply the instruction to the insult where they land. [rb]]]]]</p>}

<h2>Notes [rna]</h2>
{-na
<p>This puzzle was written over a year before <a href='https://puzzles.mit.edu/2022/puzzle/reepicheep/'><cite>Reepicheep</cite></a> from MITMH 2022’s prologue hunt, <cite>Star Rats</cite>, but of course Star Rats came out before QOPH because we just took so damn long to get the hunt off the ground. In a sense, you could say that Reepicheep actually encouraged me to get QOPH up and running sooner rather than later to avoid further snipes of this kind. (Fortunately, it turned out that the puzzle mechanic in Reepicheep was actually completely different.)</p>
<p>When constructing this puzzle, I was obviously aware that 16 dropquotes would be a lot. However, solving just the first one already allows you to find the full list of insults/comebacks on the web, and indeed, all of the test solvers did so and then breezed through the rest. Despite, the feedback suggests that a number of teams found this puzzle very tedious. All I can say to that is that every good puzzle hunting team needs a gruntwork aficionado!</p>
